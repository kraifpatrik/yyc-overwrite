# YYC Overwrite
A simple command line tool that allows you to easily overwrite C++ files generated by YYC.

**Requires [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**

## How to use
1. Open your GameMaker Studio 2 project and run it using YYC
2. Near the top of the Output console you will se a line like `"C:\ProgramData/GameMakerStudio2/Cache/runtimes\runtime-2.2.2.326/bin/Igor.exe"  -j=12 -options="C:\Users\kraif\AppData\Local\GameMakerStudio2\GMS2TEMP\build.bff"  -- Windows Run`. The options path is required by the tool.
3. Run the tool using `python yyc-overwite.py`
4. It will ask for name of subdirectory with C++ files and for the path to the build.bff file. You can just press enter to leave the default values. The subdirectory for C++ files will be created automatically in the project's directory.
5. You should see a line starting with "Target directory" followed by a path where you can find the original C++ files generated by YYC. You can now copy files you want to overwrite into the created subdirectory.
6. After you make changes to the C++ files, run the tool again using the same command as in step `3.`. It will ask you if you really want to overwrite the files in case you run it by mistake.

It can happen that the files in the YYC cache directory will get overwritten or deleted when you modify GML inside GameMaker or clean cache using the brush icon. In that case just run the tool again, that is it's entire purpose.
