# YYC Overwrite
A simple command line tool that allows you to easily overwrite C++ files generated by YYC.

**Requires [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**

## How to use
1. Open your GameMaker Studio 2 project and run it using YYC.
2. Near the top of the Output console you will se a line like `"C:\ProgramData/GameMakerStudio2/Cache/runtimes\runtime-2.2.2.326/bin/Igor.exe"  -j=12 -options="C:\Users\kraif\AppData\Local\GameMakerStudio2\GMS2TEMP\build.bff"  -- Windows Run`. The options path is required by the tool.
3. Run the tool using `python yyc-overwite.py`
4. It will ask for the path to the build.bff file. You can just press enter to leave the default value.
5. The tool now prints some info about the project, including "Target directory", which is the YYC cache directory where you can find the original C++ files.
6. In GM, you can now write comment blocks with C++, which will replace the code generated by YYC. Currently only one block per script/event is supported.
```js
/*cpp
for (size_t i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
{
  YYGML_show_debug_message("It works! :)");
}
*/
for (var i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
{
  show_debug_message("It doesn't work! :(");
}
```
7. Run the tool again using the same command as in `3.`, it will now overwrite the original C++ code with the one in the comment block.
